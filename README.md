## Introduction
This code repo was used to produce the plots used in [1]. 

## Requirements
This code heavily uses the code HNABEMLAB by Andrew Gibbs. This has been slighty adapted for this purpose and the forked version ojp1995/HNABEMLAB should be used.
This code was ran using MATLAB 2022a, there might be some functions that may or may not work with newer or older versions.
